The test case created for test_register_user is designed to validate the functionality of the register_user function. 
It begins by verifying that a new user can be successfully added to the system, ensuring the username meets the minimum length requirement set by MIN_USER_NAME_LEN. 
Once the registration process is executed, the test checks that the user's data is stored within the users' dictionary, including an integer level and a hashed version of the password for security. 
Moreover, the test case asserts that an attempt to register a user with an existing username does not lead to duplication in the user database, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity.

The test_delete_restaurants test case, though not explicitly detailed here, would follow a similar rigorous process, focusing on verifying the functionality of a 
hypothetical delete_restaurants function. This test would likely ensure that a restaurant, once deleted, is no longer present in the restaurant's data storage and 
that attempting to delete a non-existent restaurant entry handles the situation gracefully, without causing errors or exceptions. The deletion process would be 
thoroughly checked for idempotency, confirming that repeated deletion calls have no further effect once a restaurant is removed. Both test cases together ensure 
that the user and restaurant management features of an application behave as expected, handling both the addition and removal of data correctly.
