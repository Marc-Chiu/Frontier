- Connected to MongoDB in the cloud
- Implemented Test Code for the enpoints and for each function that interfaces with the user
- We also outlined what we want our program to look like and how we want the user to interact with the web app.

## Goals
- Create a GUI for our users to interact with (e.g enter group names and other related info)
- Insert more real and/or fake data to test our webapp more
- Connect our Back End to the Front End once we make it
- Have a fully tested and function webpage
- Work on front-end development with React.js to allow user interaction and improve user experience (e.g. color changes when hovering or clicking on a button) using testing procedures that are part of our atuomated testing requirement
- Having meetings with team members to stay up to date on what needs to be done, what has been completed, distribution of work etc. This will enable us to achieve the goals quicker and efficiently
- Continue regularly updating our progress in README files
- Continue making sure we document our code for team members to follow along
