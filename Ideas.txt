A list of ideas to choose from:
	- Comedy App: Every Week the App will send out a prompt to you and your friends. You need to write a response and at the end of the week everyone votes on the funniest response. Some feature might be you can comment on responses, you can post you promt and resposnse to app for the public to see if you think its funny enough. It would be similar to a Jack Box type game (if you ever played that). 
	- Music Finder: Users can find music based on albums, artists, playlists, tracks. These could also be potential endpoints.
