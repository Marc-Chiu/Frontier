##  MashUp:
The project idea is to create an application that allows friends and family to upload nearby restaurants that best match their food preferences. There will be two main functions of our app:
- Find restaurants, so we will need add all the restaurants and the let the user filter
- Create a group of friends to share restaurants

## Build Instructions
