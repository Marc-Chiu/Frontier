# MashUp:
The project idea is to create an application that allows friends and family to upload nearby restaurants that best match their food preferences. There will be two main functions of our app:

- Create a group of friends to share restaurants

### Group Members: 
- Marc Chiu
- Hah-Young Kim
- Swanyee Aung
